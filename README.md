# HTML-Learning-Course-by-FutureSkill

Hi everyone! This is my first public repository. First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out my work. My goal with this repository is to practice both my coding skills and my English writing skills. I believe GitHub is a great platform for anyone looking to improve or switch career paths—just like me. This repository marks the beginning of my journey into software development, and I hope it will support both me and others who are working toward a future career in computational technology.

I hope you find something useful here, and feel free to share any feedback—whether through issues, pull requests, or any other contact method. Thank you!
