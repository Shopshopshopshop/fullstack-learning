        <h1>HTML Wiki</h1>

        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in
            a
            web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such
            as
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for
            its appearance.</p>

        <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium
            (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
            CSS
            over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video
            and
            audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.</p>
