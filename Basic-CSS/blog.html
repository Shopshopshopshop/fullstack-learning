    <h1>HTML Wiki</h1>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.</p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
        audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.</p>
